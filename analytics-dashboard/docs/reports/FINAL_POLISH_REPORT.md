## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Issues
1. **Form Control Styling**
   - Minor visual differences in select dropdowns across browsers
   - Not functionality-affecting
   - **Workaround**: Custom CSS could be added for consistency

2. **Virtual Scrolling Edge Cases**
   - Very rapid scrolling may cause brief visual flicker
   - Only noticeable with large datasets (1000+ items)
   - **Workaround**: Debouncing already implemented to minimize

3. **Export File Naming**
   - Generated filenames use system date format
   - May vary slightly between operating systems
   - **Workaround**: Functional as intended, cosmetic only

### Design Limitations
1. **Large Dataset Performance**
   - Virtual scrolling optimized for up to 10,000 items
   - Beyond this may require server-side pagination
   - Current implementation suitable for typical use cases

2. **Mobile Export Experience**
   - CSV download behavior varies on mobile browsers
   - Some mobile browsers may open file in new tab
   - **Workaround**: Standard mobile browser behavior

### Future Enhancement Opportunities
1. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Date range filters
   - Numeric range filters
   - Multi-select filters

2. **Column Management**
   - Drag-and-drop column reordering
   - Column width persistence
   - Custom column configurations

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Inline charts in grid cells
   - Mini sparklines for trends
   - Enhanced chart interactions
